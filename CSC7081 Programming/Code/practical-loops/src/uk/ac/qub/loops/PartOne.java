/* Part 1 â€“ 
Write a Java statement to accomplish each of the following tasks:
1. Declare variables sum and num to be of type int.
2. Assign 1 to variable num.
3. Assign 0 to variable sum.
4. Add variable num to variable sum, and assign the result to variable sum.
5. Print "The sum is: ", followed by the value of variable sum.
Combine the statements that you wrote above into a Java application that calculates and 
prints the sum of the integers from 1 to 10. Use a while statement to loop through the 
calculation and increment statements. The loop should terminate when the value of num 
becomes 11. */
