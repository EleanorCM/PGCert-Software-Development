Queues contain **non-unique elements** prior to processing. Usually **first-in, first-out** with insertions at back and deletions from front.

## Priority Queue
Based on the **heap** data structure, this orders elements according to the order specified at construction time. This is either natural order or one imposed by a Comparator.
