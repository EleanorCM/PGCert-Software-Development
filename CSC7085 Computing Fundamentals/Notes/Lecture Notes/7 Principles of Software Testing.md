1. **Show presence of defects.** We can reduce the number of undiscovered defects but can't prove there are ***no*** defects present.
2. **Exhaustive testing is impossible**. There are too many possible combinations of inputs. We use ***risk analysis and priorities*** to inform testing.
3. **Early testing**. The later defects are discovered, the more costly they are to fix.
4. **Defect clustering**. Defects tend to cluster in key areas, especially where there are ***complex requirements or implementations***.
5. **Pesticide paradox**. The same kinds of tests on repeat will eventually fail to find new bugs. Test cases should be ***regularly reviewed and updated***.
6. **Testing is context dependant**. Software where safety is critical is ***tested differently*** than a free mobile app.
7. **Absence of errors fallacy**. The absence of errors doesn't mean the system is ok. If the system can't be used or does not meet user needs or expectations, fixing defects will not help.
