It meets these criteria:
- **Unambiguous**. There is only one way to interpret the requirement - no acronyms.
- **Testable** (verifiable). Words like 'robust', 'effective', 'efficient', 'flexible' make a requirement untestable - what exactly do these mean?
- **Clear** (concise, simple, precise). Stated in the shortest and plainest way possible.
- **Correct**. Sometimes we have to query whether details in the requirement are actually correct before we implement it.
- **Understandable**. Should use the word "shall" and avoid combinations of terms.
- **Feasable** (realistic). It must be acheivable within the constraints of the project (time, cost, resources).
- **Independent**. We ***should not need to know about any other requirements*** to understand one particular requirement.
- **Atomic**. Each requirement should contain a ***single traceable element***.
- Necessary. 
- **Implementation-free** (abstract). The requirement should not tell the developers how to build the system, eg telling them how to store information.

If it ***does not*** meet these critera then it's a bad requirement.
