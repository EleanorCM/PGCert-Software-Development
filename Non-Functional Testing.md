Testing **how the system works**. Done at all test levels.

This isn't functional testing but relates to **quality assurance**. Non-functional testing includes:
- **Performance testing**. Does it meet performance criteria? What part of the system is causing bad performance?
    - **Load testing**. This is a subset of performance testing. How does it perform with a certain workload. At normal and peak conditions? Bottlenecks?
    - **Stress testing**. Testing **beyond the normal capacity** of a system. Use to determine the system's **stability**.
- **Usability testing**. How easy is it to **use and learn** the software? How **convenient** is the software for the end user? Memorability, how easy is it to make mistakes, satisfaction.
- **Maintainability testing**. Corrective, perfective, adaptive and preventative maintenance.
- **Reliability testing**. Exercising an application so that failures are discovered and removed before the system is deployed. Reliability is the probability of failure free software operation for a specified period of time in a particular environment.
- **Portability testing**. How easily can a software product be transferred from one hardware or software environment to another?
